                        There is nothing secretive about our ingredients and management which is reflected in our low countertops and transparency. We do not use artificial preservatives nor additives in our drinks. Each drink is made with fruit freshly cut and tailored to each personâ€™s taste and preference. If you have any dietary concerns, tell our bartenders and they will make the drink the way you want.

                        Originally from Taiwan, bubble tea, aka boba, milk tea or pearl milk tea, is made with a milk tea base and tapioca dessert as a topping inside the drink. It is fun, filling and delicious. Modern day bubble teas vary from many different flavours, styles, toppings and ingredients shared all over the world.

                            This city has been impactful in shaping our identity and commitment. Initially, Real Fruit Bubble Tea was an Asian based company catering to mostly Asian communities. Now, this multicultural city has influenced us to share this drink with everyone. We have become inclusive, diverse, authentic and full of energy. Throughout the years, we have been committed to making fresh fruit drinks, healthy and accessible for anyone to enjoy.
